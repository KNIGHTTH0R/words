#' \pkg{words} creates random words or sentences
#' 
#' Sometimes random words or sentences are needed as dummys or for simulation 
#' purposes. The functions in this package create random words or sentences in 
#' several languages. Note that currently the senteces are a random 
#' concatenation of words without any meaning. 
#' 
#' In the future reference lists containing the most frequent ngrams may be
#' added to have sentences that make some sense. 
#' 
#' Word lists are loaded once and are stored in the invisible object \code{.words}.
