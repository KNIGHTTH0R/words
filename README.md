# words: Create random words and sentences

Sometimes random words or sentences are needed as dummys or for simulation 
purposes. This packages allows creating random words or sentences in 
several languages. Note that currently the senteces are a random 
concatenation of words without any meaning. 

In the future reference lists containing the most frequent *ngrams* may be
added to have sentences that make some sense.
